title: Drupal as an MCP Server
description: Examine how Drupal can be used as an MCP server.
---

Drupal is uniquely positioned to serve as an MCP server thanks to its robust content management capabilities and modular architecture.  
Its content and structure can be exposed as **resources**, its built-in features (like ECA actions or AI functionality) can be leveraged as **tools**, and its extensibility allows for creating highly customized workflows.

When acting as an MCP server, Drupal becomes a powerful platform for integrating AI-driven functionality — enabling smarter, more efficient content workflows.

The modules provided here enable Drupal to comply with the MCP standard, effectively transforming it into an MCP server once installed and configured.  
They provide a foundational layer with server-side MCP APIs compatible with LLM applications. From there, developers and other modules can extend Drupal’s capabilities by defining and exposing **resources**, **tools**, and **prompts** as MCP elements.
