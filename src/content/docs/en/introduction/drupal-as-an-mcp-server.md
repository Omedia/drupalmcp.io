title: Drupal as an MCP Server
description: Examine how Drupal can be used as an MCP server.
---

Drupal obviously is uniquely positioned to serve as an MCP server due to its robust content management capabilities and modular structure. Drupalâ€™s content and strcuture can be exposed as resources, its built-in functions (think ECA actions or AI functionality) can be leveraged as tools, and its extensibility enables creating highly customized workflows.

By acting as an MCP server, Drupal becomes a powerful platform for integrating AI-driven functionality, allowing organizations to build smarter and more efficient content workflows.

These set of modules enable Drupal to comply with the MCP standard, transforming it into an MCP server upon installation and configuration. Serving as a foundational layer, it not only provides MCP server APIs compatible with LLM applications but also allows developers and other modules to extend its capabilities by defining and exposing resources, tools, and prompts as MCP elements.
