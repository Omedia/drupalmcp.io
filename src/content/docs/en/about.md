# About Drupal MCP

Drupal MCP is a project focused on helping developers setup and use their Drupal installations as MCP (Management Control Panel) servers.

## What is MCP?

MCP stands for Management Control Panel, a centralized interface that enables efficient management and control of Drupal sites. This documentation site collects guides, references, links, videos, and other resources to help developers leverage the full potential of Drupal with modern MCP tools.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to simplify Drupal management through comprehensive documentation and tools, making advanced Drupal features accessible to developers of all experience levels.

## About This Documentation
