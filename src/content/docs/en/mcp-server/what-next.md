description: How to use your Drupal as an MCP server
---

Now that you’ve turned your Drupal site into an MCP server and connected it to the LLM app of your choice, you can start doing some real magic.

Ask your LLM to **add a field to a content type**, **export configuration**, or **clear the cache**. Want to create and configure a **new view**? Or build a **taxonomy vocabulary and start generating content**? That’s all possible too.

It’s entirely up to you — and if you create your own custom plugins, you can expose even more functionality to your LLMs.
