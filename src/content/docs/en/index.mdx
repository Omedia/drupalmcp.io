## Power up your Drupal with MCP

MCP (Management Control Panel) is a centralized interface for efficiently managing and controlling Drupal sites through standardized APIs. By transforming your Drupal instance into an MCP server, you unlock its potential as an AI-integrated system in the emerging agentic era, enabling automation, intelligent workflows, and seamless integration with modern AI tools. This documentation site provides comprehensive guides, references, and resources to help developers implement MCP capabilities in their Drupal projects, maximizing productivity and unlocking new possibilities.
